# Backend repository of Kreeshee.

This node js backend follows the good ol' MVC architecture.

Follow the steps below to get started -
Prerequisites - have node and npm installed on your pc.

1. Start from creating a folder where the code's going to live.
2. Open the folder inside your IDE or Code editor. (e.g. VS Code)
3. Open a terminal and clone into the repository 

``` git clone https://github.com/FunsaiSushi/kreeshee-backend.git ```

4. Install the packages listed in the package.json file

``` npm i ```

5. Do not forget the .env file. Here's a sample -

``` sample env file ```

Create a file named ".env" and put the sample code there. Modify your variables as needed.

6. This app uses Google Firebase for authentication, Cloudinary for storage and MongoDB as the database. Go ahead and create accounts in each to get your env credentials.
